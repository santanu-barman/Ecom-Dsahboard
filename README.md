The workbook "E.Com Dashboard.xlsx" contains the following sheets:

orders – Likely includes sales transactions, dates, quantities, and revenue.

Analyse – Possibly a working sheet used for analysis or pivot tables.

Next, I’ll inspect the contents of the products, customer, and orders sheets to understand the dataset and generate an appropriate summary and report.

The transaction table—central to performance analysis like revenue, cancellations, delivery timelines, etc.

📊 Dashboard Metrics & Features
The Dashboard (not yet examined but typically includes):

Total Sales & Orders

Top-Selling Products

Revenue by Category or Time

Delivery Performance (Delivered vs Cancelled)

Customer Distribution by Brand & OS

📈 Detailed Analysis Report
1. Sales Performance
Orders are linked with products and customers to calculate total sales, order volume, and pricing patterns.

Filters for delivery status help isolate successful transactions from cancellations.

2. Product Insights
Product popularity derived from Quantity sold, Rating, and Number of people rated.

High-ticket items (e.g., iPhones) vs. high-volume items (e.g., chargers) are identifiable through cross-analysis.

3. Customer Segmentation
Segment customers by:

Location (City, State)

Device Usage (Phone Brand, Operating System)

Helps in targeted marketing and product development strategies.

4. Delivery Analytics
Tracks delivery timelines (where available) to measure logistics efficiency.

"Cancelled" vs "Delivered" analysis helps identify fulfillment issues.
